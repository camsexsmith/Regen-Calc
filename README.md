# Regen-Calc
 
 This is going to do rocket engine regen cooling calcs.
 We'll see how it goes I guess.

 CEA DATA
 Data taken from a CEA run with LOX-RP1 400 PSIA Chamber Pressure and O/F = 1.5 with frozen conditions

 ENGINE CHARACTERISTICS
 Engine values are very arbitrary currently. Just values that "look" good enough at this point. Will revist

 HEAT TRANSFER
 Using the Bartz Equation for calculation of the hot gas film coefficient. Not ideal for calculation of the chamber since it's meant primarily for the heat transfer in the nozzle section. I mean, it's heat transfer, it's going to be wrong no matter what equation you use. Might want tot switch to an equation with less variables pertaining to the nozzle parameters.
